This project is code for a discord bot that can interact with dropbox through messages in discord channels.

To use, you need to have accounts for both the discord and dropbox APIs and paste your keys.

This bot has an additional caption functionality which uses pillow to caption a random image
from dropbox and send it to the discord channel.

This is my first public GitHub project so feel free to contact with suggestions or for help!
